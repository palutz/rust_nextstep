# Helloworld Tonic

A simple test of a cleint and server application with protobuf (using Tonic)

Added a little extra: created a multithreaded client sharing the same connection to the server



To run the server: 

```
cargo run --bin helloworld-server
```

To run the client (on another terminal)
```
cargo run --bin helloworld-client
```
