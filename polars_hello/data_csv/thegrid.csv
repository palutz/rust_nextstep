SAP Blockchain-as-a-Service is a means to access blockchain services provided by companies such as Hyperledger Fabric, MultiChain, and Quorum.

Through SAP blockchain components: SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain, and the SAP HANA Blockchain Service which enables enterprise blockchain platforms to connect to SAP HANA.

SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain integrates with the rest of an SAP ERP system using SAP Leonardo. This can be used for many functions such as mobile device management, shipment tracking, and wireless security networks.

More recently, in order to simplify integration SAP created the Business Blockchain Bridge (B3). This can connect many business applications with a blockchain network using APIs so that a business can perform transactions, messages and transfer virtual assets.

SAP has also been working on integrating blockchain in many ways in the SAP Business Network so that a network of trusted first, second, and third tier suppliers can collaborate more easily."

Global cross-border transactions are expected to reach US$156 trillion in 2022, and the Partior platform aims to solve pain points in payments — such as slow settlement speeds and expensive transaction fees — for financial institutions by digitizing commercial bank money and using an “atomic,” or instant model to replace the sequential way payments are settled currently.  This would cut the time needed to settle the transactions between banks from days to seconds, which would free up liquidity and lower settlement risk.

The initial and primary use case for this network will be in form of elastic sidechains for the Ethereum Blockchain. In this context it can be described as an ‘Elastic Sidechain Network’.
Sidechains in the network are operated by a group of virtualized subnodes selected from a subset of nodes in the network and are run on all or a subset (multitenancy) of each node’s computation and storage resources. Each sidechain is highly configurable, with consumers being able to choose their chain’s size, consensus protocol, virtual machine, parent blockchain, and additional security measures (e.g.virtualized subnode shuffling frequency)."

Hyper Mint,Startup,https://hypermint.com,,Retail & E-Commerce,"NFTs,Blockchain Development Services",NFT infrastructure for enterprises and brands,"With HyperMint, you can design, configure and deploy smart contracts at scale. HyperMint provides a standard smart contract library for common use cases, but you can use your own existing smart contracts too. 
Once deployed, HyperMint allows you to execute calls on these smart contracts over our REST API, where we take care of the heavy lifting.
HyperMint provides a basket of modular Core Features such as allow lists, royalty management, fund splitting contracts, snapshots, token gating, and more. These can be optionally added to any contract to build out your dream Web 3 experience.
 
How is HyperMint different from current tooling?
HyperMint manages blockchain interactions on your behalf; we talk to the blockchain so you don't have to. This is the core of the platform approach to Web3. Gas fees, nonce management, sequencing and finality are handled by HyperMint's platform, allowing you to focus on building the best products and customer experiences.
HyperMint was founded by a team internal to MoonPay. During our time building payments products for the likes of OpenSea, MetaMask, Phantom, and Trust Wallet, we learned just how difficult it is to build compliant, scalable and effective Web3 experiences. As a MoonPay company, HyperMint helps you take end-to-end ownership of the Web3 journey: NFT Card payments, regulatory compliance, and taxation are all embedded into our products."
